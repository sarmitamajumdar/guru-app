# 💖 **Support the Project**

   If you believe in technology that **connects and heals**, please consider supporting the development of the Guru App.
   I’m reaching out with something very close to my heart — the GURU App. It's a voice-based, multi-language mobile app designed to comfort and accompany our elderly, especially those living alone.
   
   No complicated features, just a kind voice that listens, reminds, shares spiritual words, and brings comfort.

   # Alternatively:
   I have launched a fundraising campaign on GoGetFunding to make this vision a reality:
   
   https://gogetfunding.com/support-the-guru-app-empowering-lonely-elderly-lives/  
   
   Even a small contribution can light up a lonely heart. Sharing the link would mean the world to me if you can't donate.

_Your support can help us make this app available to more elderly users across India._
